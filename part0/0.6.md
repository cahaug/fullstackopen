Steps for Client to Create & Display a New Note:
1. Adding a note
    - Client types in note and hits return key or clicks "Save" button.
    - The new note is appended to the notes array and is displayed on the Client Browser render of the page.
    - Javascript formulates a POST request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa with JSON in the form of { content: "content", date: "new Date @ time of request" }
    - Server returns status code 201 indicating the note was successfully added to the database of notes, and the message of { message: "note created" } is console.logged.
    - The page does not refresh, even if you add multiple notes.
