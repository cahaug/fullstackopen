Steps for Client to Display Notes Page & Create a New Note:
1.  We get the webpage from the server
    - Client GET from server https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes
    - Server sends response of 200 along with the html code for the Heading and the text box, which begins rendering immediately on the client's browser.
    - The browser is reading the code in "/notes" from top to bottom and rendering as it goes, when it reaches the line in the header for the css, and the browswer retrieves main.css from https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css.
    - Server sends response of 200 along with the css code for the page, the browser incorporates this into the render.
    - Likewise, the browser sees a script in the header of "/notes", instructing the browser to request main.js from https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.js
    - Server responds with 200 and sends the script, which is immediately run on arrival.
    - The Javascript which has started to run in main.js uses XML to send a GET request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json
    - Server responds back 200 and returns the list of all notes, which is then rendered to the screen.
2. Creating a new note
    - Client types out new note into form on "/notes"
    - Client pushes "Save" or presses return key, browser proceeds to send a POST request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note in the form { note: note_data }
    - Server Accepts, sends status 302 and triggers refresh to the page.
    - Client Browser returns to step 1, GET from https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/notes, and proceeds through the rest of the substeps in Step 1, refreshing and rerendering and repainting the page.
