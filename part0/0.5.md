Steps for Client to Display Notes Page (Single Page App):
1. We GET the webpage from the server
    - Client Browser sends a GET request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa
    - Server returns a status 200 and the html code for the page.
    - Client Browser opens the returned HTML package and begins rendering.  Brower parses the stylesheet link, and sends a GET request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/main.css
    - Server returns a status 200 and the CSS for the page.
    - Client Broser begins rendering the stylesheet, but simultaneously retrieves the spa.js parsed from the header script from https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa.js
    - Server returns a status 200 and the javascript for the page, which the browser begins to render.
    - Located in spa.js also uses XML to make a GET request to https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/data.json, which is executed as soon as it is run.
    - Server responds 200 and returns data.json, which the javascript engine renders into the list we see, using forEach.
